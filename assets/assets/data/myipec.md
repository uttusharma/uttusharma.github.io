I am introducing ‘MyIPEC’ a mobile Application software which
would be a miniature of the college Portal.
This application comes with responsive and minimalist UI which serves a
comfortable view for mobile devices as ipec live website is designed to serve only desktop version. This application is helping the student to view attendance directly once signed in, this app automates the step that is needed to be followed to view attendance, and also students can view attendance on the table which is completely different from the traditional table which Ipec Live
serves.
This app not only works as a website, but this app will also work as a micro student management system as it automates steps and can parse Information from the portal. The app is programmed in such a way that it loads data from the ipec portal much faster than the browser.
