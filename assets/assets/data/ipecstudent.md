IPEC Student's app will work as a micro student management system as it automates steps and can parse Information from the portal. The app is programmed in such a way that it loads data from the ipec portal much faster than the browser.

This application comes with a responsive and minimalistic UI which serves a comfortable view for mobile devices as ipec live website is designed to serve only desktop versions. This application is helping students to view attendance directly once signed in. This app automates the step that is needed to be followed in order to view attendance and also students can view the attendance table which is completely different from the traditional table which IPEC Live serves.
