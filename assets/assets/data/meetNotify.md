# Meet Notify : Chrome Extension

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uttusharma/meet_notify/master/icon-128x128.png)

A chrome extension that will listen to given keywords in google meet chat and sends a notification whenever a keyword is detected in the google meet chat.

I've made this project just to learn and explore about browser extension.

## Possible use cases

 During online classes on Google meet, most teachers share their screens to present presentations in full screen. Students who have joined the meeting without any microphone write in chat, but since the teacher is presenting the screen in full-screen, they are unable to read the chat messages. This extension allows users to set a keyword. So, whenever students type that keyword in the chatbox extension, it will send a system notification notifying them that the keyword has matched.
